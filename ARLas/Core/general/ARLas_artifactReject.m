% This method uses quartiles, suggested by Tukey.

rms = sqrt(mean(data.^2,1)); % compute the rms amplitude of each buffer
tolerance = 'moderate';
doPlot = 0; % turn off plotting
[indx,nRejects] = AR(rms,tolerance,doPlot); % find the buffers to reject
data = AR_engine(data,indx); % actually peform the rejections
