%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% [pathName,folderName,fileName] = mostRecentCalibrationLT(calPathName);
%
% Find the location of the most recent calibration file (long tube, LT).
% 
% Input Arguments:
%   calType = A string specifying the type of calibration files desired:
%                 'thev' (for thevenin source) or 'mic' (for microphone)
%                 location is fixed based on the type--
%                      'C:\myWork\ARLas\Peripheral\calibrations\thevCals\'
%                      'C:\myWork\ARLas\Peripheral\calibrations\micCals\'
%   probeLabel = A string specifying the probe being used. This is obtained
%                from [inputs,outputs] = hardwareSetup, and is either
%                inputs.label or outputs.label.
%   probeCh = 1 or 2. This value specifies the output channel of the
%                probe. The value is unused if calType is 'mic', because
%                there is only one microphone per probe.
%
% Output Arguments:
%   pathName = A string specifyin the local directory where desired calibration
%                 file is located.
%   folderName = A string specifying the folder within calPathName
%                 containing the most recent calibration file. Calibration 
%                 folders are all of the form 'dd_mm_yyyy'.
%   fileName = A string specifying the name of the file that is the most 
%                 recent calibration.
