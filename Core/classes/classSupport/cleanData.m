% Used in applying Thevenin source calibration to cavity and/or ear canal recordings.

% X (input argument) = matrix of input waveforms
% fs = sampling rate (Hz)
% stim (input argument) = waveform vector; the original electrical stimulus that was used to obtain X
% cut1 = cutoff value to remove excess zero padding at the start of the signal
% cut2 = cutoff value to remove excess zero padding at the end of the signal
%
% X (output argument) = the lowpass Butterworth filtered (22 kHz cutoff), 
%       truncated waveform w/ artifact rejection and 3 ms onset/offset windowing
% stim (output argument) the stimulus with the same filtering and windowing applied.
